# start with a description of the game!

# Tic Tac Toe is a 2 player game on a 3x3 board
# each player takes a turn and marks a square on the board
# the first platyer to reach 3 sqaures in a row, including diagonals, wins
# if all 9 sqaures get filled with no 3 in a row, the game is a tie


# then, build out the sequence:

# Display the empty 3 x 3 board
# ask the user to pick a square
# computer picks a square
# display updated board state
# loop this until either a win or a tie;
  #if a winner, display winner
  # if a tie, display tie
# play again?
# if yes, clear board and go to #1
# good bye!
